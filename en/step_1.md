Unity uses x, y, and z coordinates to position objects in 3D space.

A unit, the length of a grid square, corresponds to 1 metre in the real world.

If you add a plane and don’t rotate it, then x and z give the coordinates on the plane and y gives the up and down coordinates from the plane.

Coordinates are given as a ‘Vector3’ or three numbers. The centre or default position of the world is (0, 0, 0).

(0, 1, 0) is a position at the centre and 1 metre up.

(1, 0, 1) is a position on the plane (y = 0) and one unit away in the x and z directions.
