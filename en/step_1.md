Unity uses X, Y and Z coordinates to position objects in 3D space.

A unit, the length of a grid square, corresponds to 1 metre in the real world.

If you add a plane and don’t rotate it then, X and Z give the coordinates on the plane and Y gives the up and down coordinates from the plane.

Coordinates are given as a ‘Vector3’ or 3 numbers. The centre or default position of the world is (0,0,0).

(0, 1, 0) is a position at the centre and 1 metre up.

(1, 0, 1) is a position on the plane (Y=0) and one unit away in the X and Z directions.
